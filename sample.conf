;; Per-room configurations --------------------------------------------
;;   Make sure each room has distinct values for these parameters.

;; The name of the room
(room-name "Gauche")

;; The description of the room.  If you use non-ascii characters,
;; make sure they are UTF-8.  The string appears 'as is' in the
;; chat room HTML, so you can use HTML tags, but it's your responsibility
;; to escape HTML special characters if you don't want them to be
;; interpreted as HTML tags etc.
(room-description "A chat room for discussion on Gauche, and Scheme
 programming language in general.  Both English and Japanese chatters
 are welcome.")

;; The port number of the COMET server
(comet-port 9997)

;; The path part of the URL to the chat room
(url-path   "/chaton/gauche/")

;; The filesystem path in the server where chatroom public stuff resides.
;; The contents of this directory must be visible through httpd
;; via #`",|httpd-url|,|url-path|"
(server-htdocs-dir "/home/shiro/practical-scheme.net/chaton/gauche/")

;; The data directory where logs etc. will be placed.  It is recommended
;; that this directory is not visible through httpd.

(icon-url "http://practical-scheme.net/images/chaton-room-gauche.gif")

;; Set #f to restrict access to the chat content only through valid steps
;; (either via 'apilogin' or 'entry').  Restarting the comet server invalidates
;; client's session credentials (cid) and forces clients to reload the

;; room using http authentication, however, you have to restrict access
;; so that rogue client cannot bypass http authentication.
